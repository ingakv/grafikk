# PROG2002 Graphics programming Autumn 2023

In 2023, I took a course at NTNU called **Graphics Programming**, where we explored the fundamentals and advanced concepts of computer graphics using OpenGL. This course focused on practical and theoretical aspects of rendering 2D and 3D environments, as well as programming with C++ and GLSL. In this repo I have included the work I made during this course, with some extra tweaking added later on.

### What I Learned

The course covered the following core topics:

* **The OpenGL Graphics Pipeline:** Understanding and utilizing the pipeline for rendering 2D and 3D scenes.
* **Geometric Transformations:** Applying mathematical transformations to manipulate objects in space.
* **Colors, Textures, and Blending:** Techniques for enhancing visual realism and creating dynamic effects.
* **Shader Programming with GLSL:** Writing custom shaders for controlling object appearance and lighting.
* **Illumination Techniques:** Implementing lighting models for realistic rendering.

### Projects and Highlights

During the course, I completed several mandatory programming assignments and projects:

* 5 labs, which I have here combined into 3
* A bigger assignment
  * Consisted of creating a 3d chessboard with cubes for chess pieces
  * It is possible to move the board with your keyboard, as well as moving the chess cubes
  * Make a framework that can be used to complete the assignment
    * This framework is also used for the exam
* The final exam
  * Make a game where the player can move certain boxes into target locations
  * All items; player, boxes, target locations, and the wall bounds are all randomized
  * I got an A ðŸ¤ 

These projects demonstrated my ability to:

* Write efficient C++ code using modern development tools like CMake and Git.
* Utilize OpenGL to build visually appealing graphics applications.
* Apply mathematical and programming concepts to solve complex rendering problems.

### Tools and Technologies

* **Programming Languages:** C++
* **Libraries/Frameworks:** OpenGL, GLSL, CMake
* **Version Control:** Git
