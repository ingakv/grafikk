# PROG2002 Assignment Description

The task of the assignment is the creation of a simple chess-like application that will display a board with two sets of cubes (one per player) that will be initially arranged in a board (8x8 by default) having different types of tiles; unlike chess, we only have one type of unit. The pieces can be moved anywhere in the board, provided that there is not any other unit occupying the same tile. The application must allow to move the camera around the board, in a circular fashion (looking to the center) and display a selector (always visible) that will highlight units as it moves through them. The application will provide visual help to move a unit to another place; in this case the unit will be highlighted in a different color until it moves, then the unit will take its original color or the selector color if it applies.
